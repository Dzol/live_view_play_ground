# LiveViewPlayGround

To start the Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
Follow the links under the _Stuff_ section.

Mix created tonnes of files.
Some of which probably aren't needed.
Just check out [the code using LiveView](lib/live_view_play_ground_web/live/).
